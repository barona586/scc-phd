\section{Introduction}
The School of Computing \& Communications is committed to providing effective PhD supervision and appraisal of PhD progress, leading ultimately to successful completion. The overall target for full-time PhD students is submission of their thesis within 3 years. With the University stipulating a maximum completion deadline of 4 years.


\input{common}


\section{Appraisal points} \label{sec:points}

The schedule of appraisal points set out below are the default for a full-time PhD student, and are from the PhD start date. Normally the deadline is calculated from the PhD start date, e.g.\ for a PhD starting in October, the 4-month progress report would be due on 1st February the following year, and the 10-month progress report and research proposal due on 1st August. An individual's schedule may change, for example if there are periods of intercalation. You will receive reminders for each appraisal point a month before the submission deadline.

A summary of the requirements for each appraisal point is provided in Table~\ref{table:points}, with further details provided in the sections below. After each appraisal point the details of the next appraisal shall be arranged, with the submission deadline confirmed, and any necessary panel meeting scheduled.

\subsection{4 months} \label{sec:4months}
The first review is designed to ensure that good foundations for the PhD have been established and appropriate planning has taken place. To this end, the following should have been completed by this stage:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Attended compulsory induction with the School, and ideally with the Faculty and the University.
\item Discussion with supervisor(s) about required training and development of skills, and an initial plan agreed for addressing these needs.
\item Initial research questions and direction developed.
\item A presentation to the department, presenting the research challenge and the plans for the PhD. This could be in the form of a poster presentation at the annual department PhD event, but could also be in another form (e.g.\ department seminar). If no opportunity for this has occurred, please make plans for coming months.
\item An agreed initial completion timeline, with appropriate milestones.
\item Research profile setup on \href{https://pure.lancs.ac.uk}{University research portal (Pure)}.
\end{enumerate}

The \hyperref[sec:report]{progress report} should be started and submitted to \href{https://modules.lancaster.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=7050}{Moodle} by the first day of the 5th month of registration, confirming the above items have taken place, and providing details where necessary.


\subsection{10 months (Confirmation Panel)} \label{sec:10months}
The second review includes the Confirmation Panel for the PhD, this is an important formal assessment of the viability of the PhD, and initial progress. The assessment is based upon a \textbf{Research Proposal}, the updated \hyperref[sec:report]{Progress Report}, and an appraisal panel meeting with a \textbf{Research Presentation}. The research proposal and updated progress report must be submitted via \href{https://modules.lancaster.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=7050}{Moodle} by the first day of the 11th month of registration. The Confirmation Panel meeting will be scheduled as soon as possible after this (expected within one month).

\subsubsection{Research Proposal}
An 8--10 page document which sets out the research to be carried out during the PhD. The precise structure of the proposal can differ between PhD students, but it should normally contain as a minimum:
\begin{itemize}
	\item A proposed title for the PhD.
	\item A section introducing the research topic, motivating the research, and setting out the research questions to be addressed.
	\item A substantial literature review, critically analysing related work, and clearly highlighting the novel aspects of the proposed research.
	\item A proposed methodology, describing how the research will be undertaken.
	\item Ethical considerations.
	\item A bibliography, listing references cited in the proposal (not included in page count).
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Confirmation Panel meeting}
A 10-minute \textbf{Research Presentation} should be prepared for the meeting, this will summarise the research proposal. The \hyperref[sec:panel]{panel} will ask questions arising from the presentation, research proposal and progress report. The PhD student will be asked to step out of the room whilst the \hyperref[sec:panel]{panel} discusses their assessment. The PhD student will be invited to return to discuss the outcome of the confirmation panel. The meeting should not last more than 1 hour in total.

\subsubsection{Outcomes}

\begin{description}
	\item[Confirm as PhD] If the \hyperref[sec:panel]{panel} is satisfied that the foundations exist for a viable PhD and satisfactory progress has been made, a recommendation will be made to confirm as PhD.
	\item[Defer decision] If after the first meeting the \hyperref[sec:panel]{panel} have reservations about the viability of the PhD, or major concerns about the quality of the work submitted, it will be recommended that a reassessment takes place within 4 months. The reassessment will be in the same form as the initial assessment, with both the Research Proposal and Progress Report resubmitted, addressing the feedback received in the first confirmation panel. The date of the resubmission and second confirmation panel will be agreed at the time of the first confirmation panel.
	
	There will only be one opportunity for reassessment. Following the second confirmation panel, the following options are available:
	\begin{description}
		\item[Confirm as PhD] If the appraisal \hyperref[sec:panel]{panel} is satisfied that the foundations exist for a viable PhD and the concerns raised have been addressed, a recommendation will be made to confirm as PhD.
		\item[Confirm as MPhil] If the concerns raised in the first confirmation panel have not been addressed to a satisfactory level, and the \hyperref[sec:panel]{panel} have significant concerns about the viability of the PhD, but believe the work could be completed as an MPhil, it can be recommended that the student transfer to an MPhil.
		\item[Recommend exclusion] If the concerns raised in the first confirmation panel have not been addressed to a satisfactory level, and the \hyperref[sec:panel]{panel} have significant concerns about the viability of the PhD, and believe the work could not be completed as an MPhil, it can be recommended that the student does not continue their studies.
	\end{description}
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Feedback}
After the first confirmation panel, the \hyperref[sec:panel]{appraisal panel} shall produce a report (1--2 pages) containing feedback and recommendations, and detailing any concerns raised. The subject specialist shall lead the writing of this report. If a second confirmation panel is held, further feedback and the final recommendation shall be added to the report

In addition, a confirmation panel form (available from \url{http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/current-staff/registry/student-forms/}) must be submitted to the Postgraduate Teaching Office, along with a copy of the feedback report. This should be submitted after the first confirmation panel, and the second panel if applicable. These are required for student registry to confirm the continuation of the PhD.


\subsection{16 months} \label{sec:16months}
An updated \hyperref[sec:report]{progress report}, including a brief reflection on the confirmation panel feedback, to be submitted via \href{https://modules.lancaster.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=7050}{Moodle} by the first day of the 17th month of registration.


\subsection{22 months (annual review)} \label{sec:22months}
An updated \hyperref[sec:report]{progress report}, including a summary of the state of the research, to be submitted via \href{https://modules.lancaster.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=7050}{Moodle} by the first day of the 23rd month of registration, alongside a second document containing an initial \textbf{thesis structure and plan}.

A subsequent meeting will be arranged between the PhD student and \hyperref[sec:panel]{appraisal panel members} (expected within 1 month). Progress will be discussed along with plans for the third year of the PhD.


\subsection{28 months} \label{sec:28months}
An updated \hyperref[sec:report]{progress report}, including a brief reflection on the annual review feedback, to be submitted via \href{https://modules.lancaster.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=7050}{Moodle} by the first day of the 29th month of registration.


\subsection{34 months (annual review)} \label{sec:34months}
An updated \hyperref[sec:report]{progress report} should be submitted to \href{https://modules.lancaster.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=7050}{Moodle}, this should include a summary of the state of the research and thesis. The completion timeline should be specific and detailed at this stage, with clear milestones and a proposed submission date. This should include planned and agreed periods for supervisor feedback on thesis chapters.

A subsequent meeting will be arranged between the PhD student and \hyperref[sec:panel]{appraisal panel members} (expected within 1 month), with a focus on the completion timeline. As necessary, a series of further appraisal points will be scheduled and agreed to check on progress towards completion. These could include progress reports, further panel meetings, research talks to the School, a mock viva, amongst other items useful towards completion.
